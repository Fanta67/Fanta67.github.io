Hi, welcome to the blog! 

This purpose of this blog is just for me to have a place to document my thoughts. I have a bunch of random topics jotted down on my phone's notepad that I want to do some more thinking about, so I'll hopefully write about those things here in-depth. These topics will mostly be computer science or probability related, though I might toss in the occasional shitpost if I get frisky. Let's see this goes!
