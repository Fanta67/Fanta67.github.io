I"ð<p>Hi, welcome to the blog!</p>

<p>This purpose of this blog is just for me to have a place to document my thoughts. I have a bunch of random topics jotted down on my phoneâ€™s notepad that I want to do some more thinking about, so Iâ€™ll hopefully write about those things here in-depth. These topics will mostly be computer science or probability related, though I might toss in the occasional shitpost if I get frisky. Letâ€™s see this goes!</p>
