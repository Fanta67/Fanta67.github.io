I"Ï<p>If you ask me what my favorite number is, you‚Äôll either get the answer 7 or 9801. 7 is supposed to be lucky and my birthday falls on a 7th, but what‚Äôs so special about 9801 to make it a contender?</p>

<p>One of the first identities that we learn about fractions is that 1/3 is equal to .333‚Ä¶ repeating infinitely. A silly argument I used to get into frequently with non-math nerds was whether or not .999‚Ä¶ is equal to 1 (of course it is), but that‚Äôs for a different post. The post about infinity will probably also come soon. Anyways, infinitely repeating decimals are the building blocks for what we‚Äôre going to do today. Another simple fraction that exhibits this infinitely repeating pattern is 1/9 = .111‚Ä¶, but this one has a fun property that we can exploit for an interesting pattern. The repeating 1 happens to be the same number that appears in our numerator 1/9. So what happens when we apply this division by 9 again?</p>

<p>Applying a division by 9 on a number that is composed of an infinite number of 1‚Äôs to the right of the decimal, as expected, gives us another gibberish decimal that goes on indefinitely. However, the defining characteristic that makes this new number so interesting is the pattern that we see in the decimal. Instead of plugging 1/81 into a calculator, let‚Äôs think about what happens when we break this down into 2 steps of dividing by 9. We already saw what happens with the first division, and we can think of the second division as replacing each 1 in the repeating decimal with a 1/9. We then replace that 1/9 with its infinitely repeating decimal form and we find that it produces a number that leaves us thorougly confused! Okay it‚Äôs hard to spell out what I‚Äôm trying to say here. Let‚Äôs take a step back (or if you already get it you can skip to the <a href="#actually-a-loser-haha">super awesome smart people section</a>). We start with .111‚Ä¶ from our first division by 9. Take note that this can be rewritten as:</p>

<p>.1 + .01 + .001 + ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>We can then replace each of these 1‚Äôs with a 1/9, so we have this decimal where each decimal place is a 1/9. Let‚Äôs pretend that‚Äôs legal in our number system. At this point, our summation is rewritten as</p>

<p>.(1/9) + .0(1/9) + .00(1/9) + ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>From here, we know that 1/9 = 0.111‚Ä¶ so if we replace each of these 1/9‚Äôs with their decimal equivalent, we get the following sum:</p>

<p>.0111‚Ä¶ + .00111‚Ä¶ + .000111‚Ä¶ + ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Adding digit-wise, we get that the sum is 1/81 = .012345679012‚Ä¶</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the interesting part about this is the pattern we find in the repeating decimal. Can you see what it is? Wow! uhhhh so we learned how to count single digit numbers again¬ø¬ø?? The more astute of you readers might also realize and ask - ‚Äúhey man what about 8? Is that a typo? Why do we go from 7 to 9?‚Äù and to that I respond <a href="#this-is-a-dumb-question">here</a></p>

<h3 id="actually-a-loser-haha">Super awesome smart people beyond this point</h3>

<p>Cool, so we found that 1/81 exhibits this property because it happens to be the square of 1/9 and 1/9 happens to result in infinitely repeating 1‚Äôs. Where does 9801 come into play? Your inner mathematician might be yelling, ‚ÄúI know my 1 digit numbers now! I‚Äôm ready for 2 digit numbers!‚Äù Haha calm down there Ramanujan</p>

<p>So how do we get an extra digit? Let me give you a sneak peek of the infinity post. Density of an infinite value doesn‚Äôt change it‚Äôs magnitude. For 1/9, we have an infinite number of 1‚Äôs after the decimal, all packed up right next to each other. If we need an extra digit to count two digit numbers, we can simply spread the 1‚Äôs apart. That is, if we could space out our .111‚Ä¶ with .010101‚Ä¶ instead, we could learn to count with up to 99. Interesting enough, 99 just happens to be the number we need, as 1/99 = .010101‚Ä¶! It‚Äôs actually nuts how numbers just WORK unlike my CS projects. What was I thinking becoming a CS major? Anyways, I digress.</p>

<p>What does this mean for building 2 digit numbers? Well simply put, the 0 that we use as a separator for our 1‚Äôs allows us an extra digit to work with. This means that we don‚Äôt actually reset to 0 until we hit 99, and this means that we start our decimal at 00.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In this post, we explored infinitely repeating decimals with a pattern. 1/7 produces the repeating decimal .142857‚Ä¶ and 2/7 produces the same cycle of numbers but starting with a 2.
    <ul>
      <li>Can you think of a fraction that makes our counting start at a different number?</li>
      <li>Can you come up with a mathematical reasoning behind why this occurs?</li>
      <li>What kind of tricks can you do with 1/7?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We can actually make the full version of the counting decimal that doesn‚Äôt skip over 8. In its full reduced form, this fraction is 137174210/1111111111. What can we do with this fraction to uncover more patterns?</li>

  Just kidding it's just because of the carryover during the addition when one of our digits would have hit 10.
  On the other hand 8 is a dumb number and we don't need it anyways : )
