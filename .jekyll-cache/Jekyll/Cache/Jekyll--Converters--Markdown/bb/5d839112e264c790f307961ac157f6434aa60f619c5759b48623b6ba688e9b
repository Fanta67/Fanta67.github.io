I"<p>Hi, welcome to the blog!</p>

<p>This purpose of this blog is just for me to have a place to document my thoughts. I have a bunch of random topics jotted down on my phone’s notepad that I want to do some more thinking about, so I’ll hopefully write about those things here in-depth. These topics will mostly be computer science or probability related, though I might toss in the occasional shitpost if I get frisky. Let’s see this goes!</p>

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. -->
