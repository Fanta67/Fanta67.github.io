I"E<p>There’s a famous competition that takes place in many high school physics classes around the country - build a contraption to make a raw egg survive from the highest drop. How do colleges expand on this as both a computer science topic and a math topic?</p>

<p>The classic problem goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are standing atop a 100 story building. You have two identical eggs, and your goal is to find out the highest floor from which a dropped egg will not crack. If you drop an egg and it breaks, you cannot reuse that egg. However, if you drop an egg and it doesn’t break, you are able to do more testing with that egg. What strategy should you use for testing to minimize the number of drops needed in the worst case?</p>

<p>Let’s start by thinking about what happens when we are only given a single egg. The naïve solution would have us simply start with floor 1 and work our way up. However, this takes us a worst case of 99 drops. In computer science, we call this O(N) where N is the number of floors that we start with. We want to minimize the total number of drops needed, so we need to think about how we can do better.</p>
