I"Ñ<p>Thereâ€™s a famous competition that takes place in many high school physics classes around the country - build a contraption to make a raw egg survive from the highest drop. How do colleges expand on this as both a computer science topic and a math topic?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/">Binary Search</a> is one of the first things taught in introductory CS classes. This search method teaches newer computer scientists that a linear probing is not always the best way to go, and that a log base 2 approach comes up in many algorithms (such as sorting, tree traversal, and more!).</p>

<p>The classic problem goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are standing atop a 100 story building. You have two identical eggs, and your goal is to find out the highest floor from which a dropped egg will not crack. If you drop an egg and it breaks, you cannot reuse that egg. However, if you drop an egg and it doesnâ€™t break, you are able to do more testing with that egg. What strategy should you use for testing to minimize the number of drops needed in the worst case?</p>
