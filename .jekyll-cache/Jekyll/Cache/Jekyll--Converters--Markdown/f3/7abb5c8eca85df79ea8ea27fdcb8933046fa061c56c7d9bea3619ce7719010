I"N<p>There’s a famous competition that takes place in many high school physics classes around the country - build a contraption to make a raw egg survive from the highest drop. How do colleges expand on this as both a computer science topic and a math topic?</p>

<h3 id="problem-proposal">Problem Proposal</h3>

<p>The classic problem goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are standing atop a 100 story building. You have two identical eggs, and your goal is to find out the highest floor from which a dropped egg will not crack. If you drop an egg and it breaks, you cannot reuse that egg. However, if you drop an egg and it doesn’t break, you are able to do more testing with that egg. What strategy should you use for testing to minimize the number of drops needed in the worst case?</p>

<p>Let’s start by thinking about what happens when we are only given a single egg. The naïve solution would have us simply start with floor 1 and work our way up. However, this takes us a worst case of 100 drops. In computer science, we call this O(N) where N is the number of floors that we start with. Because we only have one egg, we can’t do any better! If the egg breaks at floor n, we would have no way to know if the egg would also break at floor (n - 1).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/">Binary Search</a> is one of the first things taught in introductory CS classes. This search method teaches newer computer scientists that linear probing is not always the best way to go, and that a log base 2 approach comes up in many algorithms (such as sorting, tree traversal, and more!).</p>

<p>If we adapt the binary search to this problem, this</p>
